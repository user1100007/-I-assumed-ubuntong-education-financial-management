4. Analyzing specific features in detail?

## @ubuntong

Creating issues or documentation for this codebase

## Copilot

I'll help you create GitHub issues and documentation for this codebase. Let me start by analyzing the code structure and creating relevant issues.I'd like to help you create comprehensive documentation and GitHub issues for the Education Financial Management System. Let me prepare a complete package of documentation and issues.

Based on my analysis of the code, here's what I'll create for you:

## **Documentation Structure**

I'll prepare:

1. **README.md** - Project overview, setup, and quick start
2. **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Architecture, code organization, and conventions
3. **USER_GUIDE.md** - End-user documentation for key features
4. **INSTALLATION.md** - Setup and deployment instructions
5. **API_REFERENCE.md** - AJAX endpoints and integrations

## **GitHub Issues**

I'll create issues for:

- **Technical Debt/Refactoring** - Code improvements needed
- **Bug Reports** - Potential issues in the current code
- **Feature Requests** - Enhancement opportunities
- **Documentation** - Missing or incomplete documentation
- **Performance** - Optimization opportunities
- **Security** - Security-related improvements

**Please clarify a few things:**

1. **Repository Details**:
   - What's your actual GitHub repository owner/name? (I assumed `ubuntong/education-financial-management`)
   - Is this a new repo or existing?

2. **Documentation Priority** (select which you need most):
   - [ ] Technical documentation for developers
   - [ ] User manual for end-users (administrators/school staff)
   - [ ] Installation & deployment guide
   - [ ] All of the above

3. **Issues Priority** (select what to focus on):
   - [ ] Bug fixes and refactoring
   - [ ] Feature improvements
   - [ ] Security issues
   - [ ] Code documentation
   - [ ] All of the above

4. **Additional Context**:
   - Is this a production system currently in use?
   - Are there specific pain points you want addressed?
   - Should I flag any specific features that need urgent attention?

Once you provide this info, I'll generate all the documentation and GitHub issues you need!
